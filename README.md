I'll help you build out the UI and flow for your Zhuzh Shop Assistant browser extension. Let's create a visualization of how this would look and work for users.

# Zhuzh Shop Assistant - Browser Extension UI & Flow

## Extension Icon & Initial State

When installed, Zhuzh Shop Assistant will appear as a small, stylish icon in the browser toolbar. The icon would be subtle but recognizable - perhaps a shopping bag with a small "Z" emblem or a sparkle icon representing the "zhuzhing" up of shopping experiences.

Here's a mapped out complete user flow and interface elements:

## User Flow Walkthrough

Let's detail the complete user flow for Zhuzh Shop Assistant:

1. **Installation**
   - User installs the Zhuzh Shop Assistant from the Chrome/Firefox Extension Store
   - A brief onboarding overlay introduces key features and asks for initial preferences
   - User grants necessary permissions for the extension to operate

2. **Activation & Detection**
   - The extension quietly sits in the toolbar, with a subtle "Z" icon
   - When user visits an e-commerce site, the icon animates/glows purple to indicate activation
   - Background processes begin analyzing the page structure to identify product information

3. **Browsing Experience**
   - As user browses product listings, subtle indicators appear near prices showing if better deals exist
   - Small "Zhuzh" badges appear on products where significant savings are available elsewhere
   - The side panel remains collapsed by default to minimize interference

4. **Product Page Enhancement**
   - When viewing a specific product, the extension automatically:
     - Displays a top banner alert if a better price is found elsewhere
     - Shows product overlay tooltips with additional information
     - Activates the side panel with the price comparison tab open by default

5. **Interactive Side Panel**
   - The side panel can be expanded/collapsed with a single click
   - Three main tabs available:
     - **Price Compare**: Shows same product across multiple retailers with pricing
     - **Coupons**: Lists available coupon codes, sorted by potential savings
     - **Chat**: Conversational assistant to answer product questions

6. **Checkout Optimization**
   - When user reaches checkout page:
     - Automatic coupon testing happens in the background
     - A small overlay shows testing progress ("Testing coupons...")
     - Best coupon is auto-applied with notification
     - Alternative payment methods that might save money are suggested

7. **Post-Purchase**
   - After purchase completion:
     - Price protection monitoring begins automatically
     - Delivery tracking information is extracted and monitored
     - Return policy details are saved for easy reference

## Technical Implementation

For building this browser extension, you'll need:

1. **Frontend Stack**:
   - HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or TypeScript)
   - React for UI components (using React's Chrome Extension boilerplate)
   - TailwindCSS for styling

2. **Extension Structure**:
   - `manifest.json`: Extension configuration file
   - Background script: For persistent state management and API calls
   - Content scripts: For page injection and DOM manipulation
   - Popup components: For user settings and preferences

3. **Perplexity Sonar API Integration**:
   - Background worker to handle API calls to Sonar
   - Service workers to manage authentication and data caching
   - Streaming response handling for chat functionality

4. **Data Flow**:
   - DOM scraping → Structure product data → Send to Sonar API
   - Receive Sonar responses → Process data → Update UI elements
   - User interactions → Update preferences → Adjust future recommendations

5. **Security & Privacy**:
   - Local storage encryption for saved preferences
   - Minimized data collection (only what's needed for functionality)
   - Clear user controls over data usage
